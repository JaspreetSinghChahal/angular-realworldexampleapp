## Angular codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, patterns, etc) with .NET Core API as backend.

## Making requests to the backend API
Clone dotnetcore-entityframework-webapi repository and run in local. Edit src/environments/environment.ts and change api_url to the local server's URL (i.e. localhost:4000/api)./

## Getting started
Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally. We use npm to manage the dependencies

Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Building the project
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the -prod flag for a production build.
